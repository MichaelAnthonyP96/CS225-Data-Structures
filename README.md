In order to build and execute tests on any of the sub-projects with CMakeLists.txt files in their main directories: 
  - mkdir build; cd build;
  - cmake ..
  - make 
  - make test
  
Otherwise use the existing Makefile in the main directory to do an in-source build:
  - make 
  - make test 
  - ./test
  - make clean
